Using the Unsplash API (https://unsplash.com/developers), developed a small web app

try searching for 'waves' and image with the desciption 'waves' should show

Using my api url in postman, sometimes i am getting data in description field and sometimes it is null. If searching for description is not giving you a response, i have in the console log of app the array of data, and any of those fields you may search by to get a desired result. On any button you may click 'view more' to see additional details of the image. Because of the pagination functionality, the images on the second page will still route to the index of image on the first page. I realize this is a defect and given adequate time i will be able to fix. This is meant to be more of a sketch of how i think these interactions should flow together.
